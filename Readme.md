### Installation
The Anaconda distribution of Python is a must.<br>
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.<br>

For Sentiment Analysis (NLP) TextBlob library is used:<br>
	pip install -U text blob<br>

### Project Motivation
For this project, I have used the Airbnb Seattle Data (2009-2016) from Kaggle to better understand:<br>
1.Which cities in Seattle provide the highest listings.<br>
2.What kind of properties are available in Seattle listings with a relatively high price and instant bookings.<br>
3.How does the host deal with cancellation policies from customers?<br>
4.How does the customer feel about their experience with the listings in Seattle?<br>
5.Price Prediction.<br>
The full set of files related to this is available on kaggle. <br>

### File Descriptions
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.<br>

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found in the post availableÂ <a href = "https://medium.com/@jainpranjal4444/how-to-break-the-ice-with-datasets-and-then-leverage-their-friendship-to-gain-useful-insights-c1301030f1c4">here</a>

### Acknowledgement
